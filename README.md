This project is intended to flash LEDs or a LCD screen to indicate where a camera has detected motion or sound. This will need outside app setup from the user to indicate which LED or LCD output is connected to which camera.

This will then tie into a Machine Learning algorithm or AI model to learn patterns of motion and sound through the connected cameras.
